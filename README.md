# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem is solved in different programming languages, and I aim to cover multiple approaches wherever possible. Feel free to explore the solutions, and if you have suggestions for improvement, I welcome your contributions or feedback!

## About

I am solving problems on LeetCode to sharpen my coding skills and keep track of my progress. This repository contains solutions to problems in areas such as:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs
- Trees
- Linked Lists
- Math
- and more...

Each folder is categorized based on the problem type or algorithm used, and the solution file names include the problem name or number for easy reference.

## Languages Used

The following programming languages have been used to solve the problems:

- C++ (`.cpp`)
- Other languages might be included in the future.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

└── README.md
```

### Example:

- `Arrays/problem1.cpp`: Contains the C++ solution for the first problem related to arrays.
- `Strings/problem3.cpp`: C++ solution for a string-related problem.
- Each solution includes comments explaining the approach and the time and space complexity.

## How to Contribute

If you have a more optimized or alternative approach to solving any of the problems in C++, you are welcome to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Add your C++ solution or improve an existing one.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add solution for problem XYZ'`).
5. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Open a pull request.

I will review your submission and merge it if everything looks good!
